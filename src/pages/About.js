                <br></br>
                <p>Young miss Dottie was rescued from a shelter in Beebe, Arkansas on February 24, 2020 after being abandoned at an apartment complex by her former owner.
                     She had to endure a grueling heartworm treatment for 6 months but now has a clean bill of health. 
                     She loves the dog park and everyone she meets... except cats.</p>
